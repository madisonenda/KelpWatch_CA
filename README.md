# A KelpWatch CA Database: Kelp Observations within California's MPA Network

## About this repository:
This repository houses the database for kelp observations across California, which were intersected with Marine Protected Area boundaries from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

## **Purpose**

- Markdown headers are used to separate each README section.
- A brief explanation of the repository’s purpose. Paragraphs or a bulleted list are both acceptable options. You may include an image or logo that represents the project.

## **Contents**
  
- A concise description of what’s housed in the repository. This includes information about the repository structure or file organization.
- No hidden files other than .gitignore are included in the repository, in particular there are no .DS_Store files.

## **Data Access**

All data used for this project is open source and available at the links provided below. While data has been filtered to regions of interest, the code to do so is housed in this repository in the kelp_cleaning.qmd file.

**KelpWatch:**
- KelpWatch is an environmental organization dedicated to improving our understanding of kelp forest distribution, abundance, and dynamics. Utilizing remote sensing data and machine learning models, they have collected a plethora of new kelp observations and predictions over the last several years. The frequency of their sampling and updates has encouraged the MPA decadal review working group to include this data in future endeavors for informing MPA habitat management.

**MPA Boundaries:**
- The Marine Protected Area network was officially designed in 1999, where discrete geographic boundaries of limited human interaction and take were set to encompass coastal and marine environments. The goal was to protect the natural diversity and abundance of marine life and representative marine habitat. The MPA network is managed by the California Department of Fish & Wildlife, and they currently house the MPA shapefiles.
